						<h1>about me</h1>
						<p>
							I'm an Indiana native with an eye for design, a passion for science, coding, and business. Most of all, though, I love blending those things together. I believe the era of the generalist is far from over, and that there's always more to learn.

							While much of my coding work has been Python/Django development, I also served as the lead designer for The Harvard Crimson's web team&mdash;below are some of my projects from the past year.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>The Harvard Crimson</h2>
						<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com"><div class="folio-entry-img a"></div></a>
						<p>In January 2013, I led a team of three to carry out a complete responsive redesign of <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com">thecrimson.com</a>, the first since late 2009, increasing our readership by over 30% year-over-year. As The Crimson's Director of Web Development, I was primarily responsible for implementing a variety of new features for the site throughout that year, as well as coordinating the training of The Crimson's new programmers during that time.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>Harvard Strong</h2>
						<a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2013/marathon/marathon.html"><div class="folio-entry-img b"></div></a>
						<p>A dark time for Boston is investigated in this in-depth feature, one of The Crimson's first. Rich multimedia elements underscore the flow of events through the narrative.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>Freshman Survey: Class of 2017</h2>
						<a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2013/frosh-survey"><div class="folio-entry-img c"></div></a>
						<p>Serving both to improve our brand on campus and collect valuable information on the incoming freshman class, my original conception of a freshman survey was immensely successful, with the information-dense feature receiving nearly 100,000 views.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>Lost and Found</h2>
						<a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2013/lost-and-found"><div class="folio-entry-img d"></div></a>
						<p>A closer look at the repatriation of cultural art from Harvard's museums lent itself to stunning visual presentation, keeping the focus of the feature on the art itself.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>Hacking Harvard</h2>
						<a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2013/hackers"><div class="folio-entry-img e"></div></a>
						<p>A clean yet striking design complements The Crimson's reporting on Harvard's computing resources and the intricate network spanning the campus.</p>
					</section>

					<section class="scroll-screen">
						<h2>Dean Michael Smith Profile</h2>
						<a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2013/smith"><div class="folio-entry-img f"></div></a>
						<p>Though a quick job, this feature visually implies (perhaps accurately) that Dean Michael Smith is always watching here at Harvard.</p>
